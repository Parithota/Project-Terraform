# Project-Terraform

# Initialization
Run the terraform init command to initialize a working directory that contains a Terraform configuration. After initialization, you will be able to perform other commands, like terraform plan and terraform apply.

# Planning
 terraform plan presents a description of the changes necessary to achieve the desired state.

 # Applying
 terraform apply performs a fresh plan right before applying changes, and displays the plan to the user when asking for confirmation.

 # Destroying
 The terraform destroy command destroys all of the resources being managed by the current working directory and workspace, using state data to determine which real world objects correspond to managed resources.
